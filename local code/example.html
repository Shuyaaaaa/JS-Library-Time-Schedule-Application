    10 examples displayed for the Time-schedule Library
    </h2>
    <p>
      The library is used for recording special events on special timestamps, 
      like a calendar or a notepad, but in a more visually rich and interactive way. 
      In this library, you will find many kinds of traditional calendars, 
      like the monthly calendar, slide calendar, agenda, timeline, timetable, to-do list, 
      time resource organization, world clock planner and so on. 
    </p>
    <h2>The 1st example: Basic Monthly Calendar</h2>
    <p>This is a basic monthly calendar. The left part day calendar represents the event detail for each day, 
      and the right part shows the month calendar structure. The default highlighted day is today.
      <br>You can click the date grid to check its event details. If the clicked date is empty, the day calendar 
      will only show you the day number. If the clicked date has an event, the day calendar will show you the 
      corresponding photo for this event.
      <br>In this example, three events are added in day 1, day 18 and day 20 separately. Therefore, when you click these three 
      grid cells, you can check its event photos.
    </p> 
    <div id="BasicMonthlyCalendar"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="BasicMonthlyCalendar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br> cg = new CalendarGenerator();
      <br> cg.BasicCalendar([
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
        date: 1,
        photo: "./img/5.jpg",
      },
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
        date: 18,
        photo: "./img/6.jpg",
      },
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
        date: 20,
        photo: "./img/7.jpg"
      }
    ]);
        
    </p>


    <br>
    <h2>The 2nd example: Yearly Timesheet</h2>
    <p>
      This is a beautiful yearly timesheet. You can check the event details directly, including the start date, end date and the event content. 
      If you move your mouse over an event, the event will be highlighted. For different events, 
      their colors will be automatically changed. In this example, five events are displayed.
    </p>
    <div id="YearlyTimesheet"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="YearlyTimesheet"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br> cg = new CalendarGenerator();
      <br> cg.Timesheet({
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start_year:2012,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end_year:2023,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events:[
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            start_month: 9,
            start_year: 2012,
            end_month: 6,
            end_year: 2015,
            content: "High School",
          },
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            start_month: 8,
            start_year:2012,
            end_month: 2,
            end_year: 2018,
            content: "My Last Relationship",
          },
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            start_month: 9,
            start_year:2015,
            end_month: 6,
            end_year: 2019,
            content: "University",
          },
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            start_month: 9,
            start_year: 2019,
            end_month: 4,
            end_year: 2020,
            content: "First Year of MEng Program",
          },
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            start_month: 11,
            start_year: 2019,
            end_month: 6,
            end_year: 2020,
            content: "Be with My Cat",
          },
        ]
      });
        
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The 3rd example: Time Resource Organization</h2>
    <p>This is a time resource organization. For keeping social distance, 
      many public facilities need to be reserved in advance to avoid crowds. Therefore, this time resource organization
      is very useful. For managers and customers, both of them can check the availability conveniently. 
      For different resources, their colors will be automatically changed. 
      If you move your mouse over a reservation (for example, Amy booked resource 1 from 9:30-10:30), the reservation will be highlighted. 
      In this example, five resources are displayed.

          ],
    
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[
            {
              start_hour: 14,

        ]
      }); 

    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The 4th example: World Clock Planner</h2>
    <p>This world clock planner displays the same events in different time zones. The chosen five cities are Toronto, 
      Vancouver, Edmonton, New York and London. The same event will be represented with same color. If you move your mouse over an event, 
      this event will be highlighted. In this example, 
      we have two events. For course 2 (the purple one), students in Toronto 
      will take it from 12:00 to 13:00, while students in London will take it from 17:00 to 18:00.
    </p>
    <div id="DailyTimeZone"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="DailyTimeZone"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br> cg.changeTimeZone({
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start_time:8,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end_time:18,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; events:[
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  {
              start_hour: 9,
              start_min: 0,
              end_hour: 10,
              end_min: 0,
              content: "Course 1",
            },
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  {
              start_hour: 12,
              start_min: 0,
              end_hour: 13,
              end_min: 0,
              content: "Course 2",
            }
          ],
      });
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The 5th example: Event Search Table</h2>
    <p>
      In this event search table, you need to enter your customized events firstly. 
      Then, you can input any date keyword in the search bar. All events that contain the date keyword will be shown dynamically.
      In this example, if we input 'jan' in the search bar, the 'New Year' event will be displayed.

    </p>
    <div id="EventSearchTable"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="EventSearchTable"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br> 	cg.SearchTable({
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; events: [
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            date: "2020/DEC/19",
            description: "csc309 Individual Due",
          },
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            date: "2020/DEC/25",
            description: "Christmas",
          },
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            date: "2021/JAN/1",
            description: "New Year",
          }
    
        ],
    
      });
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The 6th example: Basic Slide Calendar</h2>
    <p>
      The five examples before are traditional calendars. Since pictures have more direct and powerful impact to remind you of something, 
      I create this basic slide calendar. It is a calendar consisting of photos, with the event content written on the photo. You can 
      browse different events by clicking the "previous" and "next" buttons, or you can just click the dots below to locate the event you want.
      In this example, I add four events to the slide calendar.

    </p>
    <div id="BasicSlide"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="BasicSlide"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br>cg.SlideCalendar([
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
			event: "Day 1: Try to Slow Down",
			photo: "./img/1.jpg",
		},
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
			event: "Day 2: Rearrange My Hope List",
			photo: "./img/2.jpg",
	
		},
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
			event: "Day 3: Admire the Moon",
			photo: "./img/3.jpg",
	
		},
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
			event: "Day 4: Set Myself Free",
			photo: "./img/4.jpg",
	
		},
	]);
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The 7th example: Slide Gallery Calendar</h2>
    <p>
      This example make an improvement on the basic slide gallery calendar. In this slide gallery calendar, you can view all event
      images' thumbnails. So you can locate the event you want more precisely and more quickly.
    </p>
    <div id="SlideGallery"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="SlideGallery"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br>	cg.SlideGalleryCalendar([
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
        event: "Day 1: Try to Slow Down",
        photo: "./img/1.jpg",
      },
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
        event: "Day 2: Rearrange My Hope List",
        photo: "./img/2.jpg",
      },
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
        event: "Day 3: Admire the Moon",
        photo: "./img/3.jpg",
      },
    ]);
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The 8th example: Image Grid Calendar</h2>
    <p>
      This image grid calendar will show you all event images, but in  different depolyment methods. If you press the button "1", 
      there is only one column of event images; if you click '2' or '4', there are two or four columns separately. 
      If you want to check the event content, you just need to move your mouse over the event image, the text will be displayed with 
      an overlay effect.
    </p>
    <div id="ImageGrid"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="ImageGrid"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br>cg.ImageGrid([
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
			event: "Day 1: Try to Slow Down",
			photo: "./img/1.jpg",
		},
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
			event: "Day 2: Rearrange My Hope List",
			photo: "./img/2.jpg",
		},
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
			event: "Day 3: Admire the Moon",
			photo: "./img/3.jpg",
		},
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
			event: "Day 4: Set Myself Free",
			photo: "./img/4.jpg",
		},
  ]);
  </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The 9th example: To-do List</h2>
    <p>This to-do list can add, delete and cross out the event. If you want to add an event, you need to enter the event 
      in the input box. If you want to delete an event, you can click "x" button at the end of the event line. You can 
      cross out an event by clicking anywhere of the event line (except the delete button). If an event is 
      crossed out, its event line will change to a darker color. Click one more time will help you 
      return the event to its original state.
    </p>
    <div id="TodoList"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="TodoList"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br> cg.TodoList();
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The 10th example: Timeline with Shaking Effect</h2>
    <p>
      This timeline can help you with get acknowledge of your schedule directly. Firstly, you need to enter the customized events. 
      Then, on the timeline, if you move you mouse over an event image, the image will shake itself to attract your attention.
    </p>
    <div id="TimeLine"></div>
    <p  class = "txt-border">
      // HTML
      <br> &lt;div id="TimeLine"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br> //JS
      <br> cg.TimeLine({
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events:[
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            title: "2019/Aug/30",
            content: "First Arrive in Canada",
            photo: "./img/5.jpg",
          },
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            title: "2020/Jan/1",
            content: "Good Time with Crazy Friends",
            photo: "./img/8.jpg",
          },
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
            title: "2020/Sep/1",
            content: "Go to School",
            photo: "./img/7.jpg",
          },
        ]
      });
      </p>
